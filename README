Preprocessor Definitions

1. Conditional preprocessor definitions use all UPPER CASE, such as SGE_GCC, SGE_MSVC.
2. Functional preprocessor definitions use all lower case, such as sge_align, sge_thread_local.
3. Preprocessor definitions is prefixed by sge_.
4. Header gurads definitions format is MODULENAME_FILENAME_H.


Builtin Types

1. Integers are typedefined explicitly into 8bit/16bit/32bit/64bit.
2. Floats are typedefined explicitly into 32bit/64bit.
3. Don not use compiler builtin types in the code, exceptions are: dealing with
   external library, platform specific code, compiler specific code, void*.
4. Explicit narrow conversions are required between builtin types.
